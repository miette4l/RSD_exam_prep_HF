To run the tests for the 'simplemaths' module, simply open a bash terminal and change directory to the directory housing this file, simplemaths.py and test_simplemaths.py.
In the terminal, run the command: pytest
This will run through all tests and notify you if a test failed - and where it failed.
Use the docstrings in each of the test methods to understand what that test is for and how to change it. You can save changes to the code and run pytest again until all 12 tests are passed.
